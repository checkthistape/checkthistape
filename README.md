**- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @checkthistape**

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, gamedeveloping, marketing and a little bit in business, also learning new languages.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ (50%), Python (20%), MySQL (10%), JavaScript (10%) and PHP (10%). *_in percents, I noted a ratio of my time spent coding in every language._
